[REM, EM and PX] (https://engageinteractive.co.uk/blog/em-vs-rem-vs-px)

[Name a Color's Hex Code] (http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#B0B0B5)

[Less] (http://lesscss.org/)

[Fluid Typography] (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/fluid-typography/)

An important CSS selector:
```
HTML {
  font-size: 62.5%
}
```
This sets the html font size to 10 pixels, as 62.5% of 16px (default for most browsers is 10 pixels)

This way, you can use REM without much fuss, as 1rem now equals 10 pixels.

## JavaScript
